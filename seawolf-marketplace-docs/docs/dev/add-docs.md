# Add Documentation

Documentation is added in the markdown language.

See the [Markdown Cheet-Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/){:target="_blank"} for examples of how to style your text in markdown.

There is also a [Getting Started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/){:target="_blank"} guide on the same website.
