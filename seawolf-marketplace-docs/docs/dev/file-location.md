Documents can essentially be created anywhere, but it is usually easier to create folders to hold different areas of concern. These areas follow directories commonly.

For example, the dev folder above holds all the files for pages under the `DEV TEAM LOOK HERE TO ADD YOUR DOCS` menu item, but functionally it wouldn't have to as long as you link files with \[name to appear on page\](where to find it in relation to the docs folder)

So:
`[File Locations](dev/file-location.md)` is the same as [File Locations](file-location.md), which is this page.

Up next, [add your item to the side bar](update-toc.md)
